## General Info
   Zen is a e-commerce website where customer can view products, review and rate products, can add products to their cart, buy products, even chat personally with the particular seller. The customers can also become a seller which they can sell products, a person can toggle between customer and a seller.
 Sellers can view their analytics of products by weeks, months, even days, can see the reviews given by the customers, can chat with the customers to resolve the problem. This is my first own idea project.
