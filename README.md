## General Info
Zen is an e-commerce website that offers a comprehensive platform for customers and sellers. Customers can:
- View products
- Review and rate products
- Add products to their cart
- Purchase products
- Chat directly with sellers

Customers can also become sellers, allowing them to:
- Toggle between customer and seller roles
- View product analytics by day, week, or month
- Respond to customer reviews
- Chat with customers to resolve issues

This project is my first original idea, and I am excited to bring it to life.

Zen is built using the following technologies:
- **Frontend:**
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - JavaScript
  - EJS (for templating)

- **Other Tools:**
